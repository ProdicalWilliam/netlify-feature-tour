                <p>William Shakespeare was born on April 23, 1564, in Stratford-upon-Avon, England. He grew up in a pretty normal family. His dad, John Shakespeare, was a glove-maker and also worked in local government. His mom, Mary Arden, came from a farming family that had some money.</p>
                
                <p>Shakespeare went to the local grammar school where he learned Latin and Greek and read a lot of old stories. Unlike other famous writers, he didn't go to college. When he was 18, he married Anne Hathaway, who was 26 (which is kinda weird because she was way older than him). They had three kids together: a daughter named Susanna and twins named Hamnet and Judith.</p>
                
                <p>No one really knows what Shakespeare did for a few years after he got married. These years are called the "lost years" by historians because there aren't many records about him. But by the early 1590s, he had moved to London and was working as an actor and writing plays.</p>

            <div class="fun-fact">
                <strong>Fun Fact:</strong> People spelled Shakespeare's name differently ALL THE TIME - even he spelled it different ways in different documents! Some versions were "Shakspere," "Shaxpere," and "Shakspeare." Imagine if people couldn't decide how to spell your name!

            <h2 class="section-title">Most Important Works</h2>
            <p>Shakespeare wrote about 37 plays and 154 sonnets (which are like poems). His plays are usually grouped into different types: comedies (funny ones), tragedies (sad ones where people die), histories (about kings and stuff), and romances (mix of happy and sad with magical elements).</p>

                    <div class="work-title">Romeo and Juliet</div>
                    <div class="work-year">(around 1595)</div>
                    <p>This is the super famous one about two teenagers who fall in love even though their families hate each other. Everyone knows the balcony scene! It ends with both of them dying which is pretty sad. My English teacher says it's not really a love story but a warning about rushing into things.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="work-card">

                    <div class="work-year">(around 1600)</div>
                    <p>This one's about a prince whose dad was murdered by his uncle, who then married Hamlet's mom (gross!). Hamlet sees his dad's ghost who tells him to get revenge. He spends most of the play thinking about what to do and talking to himself. The "To be or not to be" speech is from this play.</p>

                    <div class="work-year">(around 1606)</div>
                    <p>This play is about a guy who wants to be king so badly that he murders the current king after some witches tell him he'll be king someday. Then he goes crazy with guilt and power. It has witches and ghosts and a lady who can't wash imaginary blood off her hands.</p>

                    <div class="work-year">(around 1595)</div>
                    <p>This is one of the funny plays with fairies and magic. There are these couples who get lost in a forest, and a fairy king and queen who are fighting, and some amateur actors putting on a play. One guy even gets turned into a donkey! It's pretty wild.</p>

                    <p>Shakespeare wrote 154 of these poems that all follow the same pattern (14 lines with a specific rhyme scheme). They're about love, beauty, time passing, and death. Some are to a "fair youth" (maybe a guy Shakespeare admired?) and some to a "dark lady."</p>

                    <p>This was one of Shakespeare's last plays. It's about a magician named Prospero who lives on an island with his daughter Miranda and controls spirits and a monster. He creates a storm to bring his enemies to the island so he can get revenge, but then decides to forgive them instead.</p>

                <h3 class="card-title">Common Themes</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Love and Relationships</strong> - Shakespeare wrote A LOT about different kinds of love. Not just boyfriend/girlfriend love, but family love, friendship, and unrequited love (when someone doesn't love you back).</li>
                    <li><strong>Power and Ambition</strong> - Like in Macbeth, characters who want power too much usually end up destroying themselves and others.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fate vs. Free Will</strong> - Shakespeare was always asking if we control our own destiny or if some things are just meant to happen (like Romeo and Juliet being "star-crossed lovers").</li>
                    <li><strong>Appearance vs. Reality</strong> - Shakespeare LOVES disguises and mistaken identity. Characters are always pretending to be someone else or things aren't what they seem.</li>
                    <li><strong>Order and Chaos</strong> - Usually his plays start with everything normal, then everything gets crazy and mixed up, and by the end things are back to normal (in comedies) or everyone's dead (in tragedies).</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

                <h3 class="card-title">Writing Style</h3>
                <p>Shakespeare's writing is known for:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Using <strong>blank verse</strong> which is poetry without rhymes that follow iambic pentameter</li>
                    <li>Tons of <strong>wordplay</strong> puns he loved making jokes with words that have double meanings</li>
                    <li>Making up <strong>new words</strong> when he couldn't find the right one he invented over 1,700 words we still use!</li>
                    <li><strong>Soliloquies</strong> where characters talk to themselves/the audience about their feelings (like Hamlet's "To be or not to be")</li>
                    <li>Using both fancy poetic language AND crude jokes - sometimes in the same scene!</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 class="card-title">Genres</h3>
                <p>Shakespeare didn't stick to just one type of writing:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Comedies</strong>: These usually end with weddings and everyone happy. They have mix of comedy and clever wordplay. E.g Much Ado About Nothing, Twelfth Night</li>
                    <li><strong>Tragedies</strong>: These end with the main character and usually lots of others dying. They're about deep emotions like jealousy, revenge, and ambition. E.g Hamlet, King Lear, Othello</li>
                    <li><strong>Histories</strong>: These are based on real English kings and historical events. E.g Henry V, Richard III</li>
                    <li><strong>Romances/Problem Plays</strong>: These are weird ones that mix happy and sad elements and often have magic or supernatural stuff. Examples: The Tempest, The Winter's Tale</li>
                    <li><strong>Poetry</strong>: His sonnets follow a specific pattern of 14 lines with a rhyme scheme of ABABCDCDEFEFGG (which I had to memorize for class)</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>His plays have been performed continuously for over 400 years no other writer can say that.</li>
                    <li>His works have been translated into EVERY major language on Earth</li>
                    <li>He added over 1,700 words to English like "bedroom," "generous," "lonely," and "critic" - imagine inventing words that everyone uses!</li>
                    <li>We use his phrases all the time without knowing it: "break the ice," "heart of gold," "wild goose chase" - these are all Shakespeare!</li>
                    <li>His stories are constantly being remade into movies and TV shows - "The Lion King" is basically "Hamlet" with lions, and "10 Things I Hate About You" is based on "The Taming of the Shrew"</li>

            <h2 class="section-title">Why Shakespeare Matters Today</h2>
            
            <div class="card">
                <p>Shakespeare's stories are still super relevant because they're about things all humans deal with - love, jealousy, ambition, family drama, etc. That's why his plays keep getting updated into modern settings (like "Romeo + Juliet" with Leonardo DiCaprio).</p>
                
                <p>In school, we study Shakespeare to learn about literary devices (like metaphors and stuff), how language has changed over time, what life was like in Elizabethan England, and to understand references in modern culture. Plus, colleges want you to know this stuff.</p>
                
                <p>Shakespeare's impact goes WAY beyond just literature - his work has influenced psychology (like understanding human motives), philosophy, politics, and pretty much everything else. He basically helped shape how we think about what it means to be human.</p>
                
                <p>Even if you think Shakespeare is boring, you're probably quoting him without knowing it. His language is everywhere in our everyday speech. And every time you watch a story about star-crossed lovers or a character driven mad by ambition or someone getting revenge, you're seeing Shakespeare's influence!</p>
