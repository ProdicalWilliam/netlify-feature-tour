            <h2>Early Life & Background</h2>
            <img class="portrait" src="/api/placeholder/250/300" alt="William Shakespeare Portrait">
            <p>William Shakespeare was born on April 23, 1564, in Stratford-upon-Avon, England. He was one of eight children born to John Shakespeare, a successful glove-maker and local politician, and Mary Arden, who came from a wealthy farming family.</p>
            <p>Shakespeare attended the local grammar school where he learned Latin, Greek, and classical literature. He didn't go to university like some writers of his time. When he was 18, he married Anne Hathaway, who was 8 years older than him. They had three children: Susanna and twins Hamnet and Judith.</p>
            <p>Not much is known about Shakespeare's early career, but by the early 1590s, he had moved to London and was working as an actor and playwright. This period is sometimes called the "lost years" because we don't have many records about what he was doing.</p>
            
            <div class="fun-fact">
                <strong>Fun Fact:</strong> Shakespeare's name was spelled many different ways during his lifetime - even by himself! Some variations include "Shakspere," "Shaxpere," and "Shakspeare."
